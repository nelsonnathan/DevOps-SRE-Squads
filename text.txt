What is DevOps philosophy? -
DevOps is the idea that writing and running code in multiple environments ought to go hand in hand

The principles of DevOps? -

Environments
*Production is the server live to the public
*Staging is the internal copy of the production server that is not public
*Local is a dev's own computer or virtual machine that all the devs on a project share

CI/CD 
*Continuous Integration: For each contribution, automatically checks the code passes tests and runs in the production environment
*Continuous Delivery: Frequently deploys new builds to stage 

Automation
*In the build process, automatically ensures code can run successfully in production
*In the production server, automatically tracks errors and issues as users interact with the software
*Monitoring to learn how users are interacting with the software to get ahead of potential issues and possible improvements that can be made
*Scaling in the case of increased user/request volume on the server

Collaboration and Joint Ownership
*Taking responsibility for issues related to builds and releases
